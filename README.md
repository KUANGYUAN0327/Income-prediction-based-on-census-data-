# Income prediction based on census data

## Remark:

Since this report is actually for a course-based Kaggle competition, I don't have the target in my testing dataset.

Therefore, I will only use the validation dataset to evaluate my models (both logistic regression and DNN model).

Anyway, **I won the 3rd place in this Kaggle competition and got high accuracy in the testing target**, so I think my models in this report is trustable.

## Introduction:

The prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.

In this report, I will use logistic regression and deep neural network (DNN model).

## Dataset:

This dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.

Data recource: UCI machine learning repository.
